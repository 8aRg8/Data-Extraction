# Data-Extraction
Data Extraction from excel file using Python


Assume that you have asked people to enter the list of their papers that they want to present in a conference or workshop in a excel file.
Se we have an excel workbook, each column contains some information such as the title of their papers, or the abstract and presentation number that they got. 
Then with some simple if function I put all of these information within one cell (seprated by a specific charector), which is for each presentation.
My goal is to print all these information nicely, to have the list of all the presenters and then to have the list of all abstracts. 
The unique point of my code is that eventhogh the same person can have different presentation, my outpu won't messed up.
For example cell 1 contains this information:
#Number 1:: Presenter1:: Title1:: Abstract1
